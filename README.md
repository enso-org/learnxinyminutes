# Enso Learn X in Y minutes

This is an Enso tutorial based on [LearnXinYMinutes.com](learnxinyminutes.com/), made during an [Enso Twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/enso_org). You can watch the recording of the stream [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3pb7HiZIBg). 

This tutorial is not yet finished, and includes some language features that have yet to be implemented. If you're new to Enso, you might prefer to get started with the [Enso 101](https://github.com/enso-org/tutorial_101) tutorial.
